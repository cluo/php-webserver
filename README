=== Http Parser extension for PHP
A PHP extension for the C http parser from Ruby's Mongrel web server.

=== Installation

To install, you'll need an environment set up to compile PHP extensions.
On Ubuntu, I think you'll need to install the php5-dev package.

cd ext
phpize
./configure
make
sudo make install

Also add the following to your php.ini file:

extension=httpparser.so

=== Usage

$parser = new HttpParser();
$parser->execute("GET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n", 0);
var_dump($parser->getEnvironment());

.. or see simple_server.php for a better example.
